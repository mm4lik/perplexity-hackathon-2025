## 💡 **Project Overview**

**Cyber Support AI Agent** is an intelligent troubleshooting assistant designed to help users diagnose and fix hardware and software issues across devices — from laptops and printers to routers and operating systems.

Built for curious users and IT professionals alike, the bot uses **real-time internet search + AI reasoning** to:

* Identify known problems (e.g., "HP laptop can't connect to WiFi").
* Suggest verified fixes.
* Guide users through multi-step solutions with chain-of-thought reasoning.
* Pull live solutions and user-reported fixes from forums, support docs, and tech blogs.

With this, users can resolve issues without endlessly scrolling forums, and IT help desks can boost efficiency.

## 🌐 **Inspiration & Use Case**

Today’s users face endless tech headaches:

* Laptops suddenly disconnecting from Wi-Fi.
* Printers refusing to connect.
* Windows updates breaking drivers.
* MacBooks not detecting USB hubs.

**Cyber Support AI Agent** taps into real-time knowledge and historical fixes from across the web using **Perplexity's Sonar API** to give clear, actionable troubleshooting guidance in seconds — without needing expert-level knowledge.

## 🌍 **Impact on Cybersecurity & IT Support**

### For Everyday Users:

* Empowers non-technical people to fix their devices confidently.
* Reduces dependency on expensive tech support services.

### For IT Teams:

* Acts as a Tier 1 support agent to offload common troubleshooting tasks.
* Reduces ticket volume by helping users self-resolve issues.

### Potential Impact Beyond:

* Can evolve into a **Cyber Threat Diagnosis Tool** by adding modules to check for common malware symptoms, phishing incidents, or Windows/Mac vulnerabilities.
